          <h3> About Me</h3>
          I graduated from college with a degree in Neuroscience and worked as a research assistant at a translational research lab and as a Psychometrician. At both places I was exposed to how software works hand in hand with science to achieve results. I wanted to play a bigger role in the building process of those programs to help solve problems across all disciplines. During quarantine, I took the time to learn the basics of coding and decided to make the jump from pre-health to software development. I joined GraceHopper Program at Fullstack Academy to develop the skill set I needed to learn quickly and efficiently. I bring my skills of inquiry, collaboration and attention to detail to web-development.
